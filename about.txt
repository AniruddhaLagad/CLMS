The CLMS is a short form for "Computer Laboratory Management System".
This is the project we have build as a part of academics project for BCA.
The CLMS is build for the colleges where the labs are limited or even for where there are appropriate to use them efficiently.
      - To avoid batch confk=licts
      - To give an equal chance to use the labs for all students.
      - To know exact shedule of the regular practical and practical exams.
      - To provide the students and teachers correct labbooks.
      - To manage staff and students as per their availablity.
      - To check lab availability.
      - To check studnets, staff availability.
      - And many more

The lab management is really essential in colleges where less numbers of labs are there. Or even for where labs are more than enough or enough.
These helps the proepr usage of labs, students, staff yeilding into the overall performance.
