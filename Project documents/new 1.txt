In the realm of educational institutions, the effective management of computer laboratories plays a pivotal role in facilitating 
seamless learning experiences for students and optimizing resources for educators. The Computer Laboratory Management System (CLMS) 
emerges as a sophisticated solution designed to streamline the operational aspects of computer laboratories within academic settings.


The Computer Laboratory Management System (CLMS) is a sophisticated solution tailored for educational institutions
to streamline the management of computer laboratories. Offering a range of functionalities, CLMS enables users to 
check practical schedules, lab availability, practical exam schedules, and track lab assignments. 
Additionally, it provides real-time information on lab occupancy, facilitates the download of lab materials, and 
ensures efficient utilization of laboratory resources. In essence, CLMS enhances the learning experience by fostering 
efficiency, transparency, and collaboration within academic environments.
