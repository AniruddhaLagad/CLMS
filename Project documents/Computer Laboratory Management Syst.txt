Great! It seems like you have a clear vision for your Computer/Practical Laboratory Management System project. Based on the points you've listed, here's how you can approach implementing each feature using HTML, CSS, PHP/Java, and PL/SQL:

Student Login, Teacher Login, Lab Administrator Login:

Implement separate login interfaces for students, teachers, and lab administrators using HTML forms and PHP/Java backend for authentication.
Record of Equipment:

Create a database table to store records of equipment such as PCs, laptops, mice, keyboards, CPUs, LCDs, desks, etc.
Implement PHP/Java functions to interact with the database for CRUD operations on equipment records.
Number of Students, Teachers, Batches, Time Slots:

Store information about the number of students, teachers, batches, and time slots in appropriate database tables.
Design HTML forms to input and update this information, with backend PHP/Java logic to handle data processing and database interactions.
Subject List:

Maintain a database table for subjects along with their details.
Create HTML forms to manage the subject list and corresponding PHP/Java scripts to handle CRUD operations on subjects.
Display Time Table, Students List, Teacher List:

Implement functionalities to display the time table, students list, and teacher list based on input parameters such as roll number, batch, or subject.
Use PHP/Java to retrieve data from the database and present it dynamically on the frontend.
Course/Department, Class, Division:

Store information about courses, departments, classes, and divisions in the database.
Design HTML forms for managing this information, with backend PHP/Java scripts to handle data processing and database interactions.
Timetable:

Design a database schema to store timetable information including subjects, teachers, batches, time slots, etc.
Implement PHP/Java functions to generate and display timetables based on user inputs or predefined schedules.
Additional Points:

As you come up with more features or requirements, integrate them into your system using the same approach of database design, frontend development with HTML/CSS, and backend development with PHP/Java and PL/SQL.
Remember to follow best practices for database normalization, user authentication, input validation, and security to ensure the robustness and reliability of your Computer/Practical Laboratory Management System.

Project Name:Computer Laboratory Managaement System
[HTML,CSS,PHP,POSTGRES]

It will have a Home Page with  university ,clg name,logo etc... Then some marquee tags, then tabs like academic, conatact, infrastrcture, student corner, examiniation, downloads,photo gallary etc. which contains functionalities by dropdown arrow, for some functionality no login is required but for some login is must. 
Then there will be small layout for login/register.
There will be background image(s).
There will be address, google map/location,contact us, like options at the bottom ofd the homepage. 
Just like a College website but not that much advanced and enhenced as our project is just computer lab management. we have to make functionaloty wiyh respect to that.
so this was our homepage.

Now after login/register or even for those functionality for which user need to login from homepage we should have next page which will conatin following:
Show all the departments, classes/divisoons,computer labs, quata/capacity of class or & lab, time tables, program /course strcture pdf/downloads,by entering roll show user date and subject name , by entering subject  name  show user date and batch, some videos of students/teachers while learning/teaching. etc. 
user should get answer for that we have frontend/backend/database connection. [HTML,CSS,PHP,POSTGRES].

with respect all this we have to find out required modules and databases for our DFD(0 and 1st level only) and ER diagram.
