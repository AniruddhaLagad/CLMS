Backend thoughts...
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have login &/ registration form in my website of Computer Laborartory Management System.
In that for to log in user need to have username and password. But before that he must completed his registration. 
Registration can take following information from the user(user acn be a student or teacher): 
students user : roll, name, course, class, batch, email, phone, username, password, address
(where roll, email, phone, username, password must be unique)
teacher user  : id, name, subjects taught, classes taughts, batches taughts, email, phone, username,password
(where id, email, phone, username, password must be unique)

loginform tells user to enter username and password. below that we have provided facility of forgot password and forgot username.
if user clicks on forgot password or forgot username then send his details on his email, also privide a option to update the password 
only if he receives his forgot password email, while updating new password tell user to enter old password once and gthen new password.

below that also for new users Registere here option is also provided.

so for this purpose we will need to create a database abd tables accordingly.

once the user login successfully then he must redirect to a new page in which there will be the main functonality/facility of 
our computer laboratory management system.

facilitys:
1. by entering roll student must be able to see his batch & his weekly practical schedule.(student)(do separte for teacher)
2. by entering lab number/lab name user(student & teacher) must be able to see whether that lab is available or not
   if not available then show labno, labname, which batch is there with teacher name.(both))
3. there must be list of PDFs for time tables of each course of each class of each batch.(both)
4. also show following labs are free on following week days.(both)
5. also show following batches have a practical and have not a practical on following week days.(for teachers)(both)
6. also show following teachers have a practicalwork and have not a practicalwork on THIS slots od the day (slots are 8 to 10, 11 to 1, 2 to 4).(both)
7. also show how many pcs, mouses,keyboards are there in a lab.(both)
    [************CHECK YOUR ASSSIGNMENT'S STATUS************]
8. also show user how many lab assignments are completed by students and how many are incomplete.(will see)
9. also show user how many lab assignments are cheked by teacher and how many are unchecked.(will see)

for this we need to create databses and tables:
student , teacher as discussed aboved and additonaly somw new tables like:
lab: labno, labname, pcs, mouses, keyboards, CPUs,etc,
assignments: assignment 1 to 6, rollno, completed/incomplete.

so with respect to this we have to craete a strong database and tables. so do it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
array of text in plsql:

tsubjects TEXT[] NOT NULL,

INSERT INTO TEACHER (tname, tsubjects, sclass, sbatch, sphone, semail, susername, spassword, saddress)
VALUES ('John Doe', ARRAY['Math', 'Science', 'English'], 'Class A', 'Batch 2023', 1234567890, 'john@example.com', 
        'john_doe', 'password123', '123 Main St');
